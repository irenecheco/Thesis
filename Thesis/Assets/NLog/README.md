# NLog â€“ Flexible logging for C# and Unity

NLog is a very light logging library with a clear focus on speed, flexibility and extensibility. It supports local and remote logging out of the box, which is extremely useful, if you want to receive log messages from a mobile device over the air.

### [-> Install NLog](#install-nlog)

## Overview
NLog consists of the following modules

Module  | Content
:-------|:-------
NLog    | Contains the core classes incl. TCP sockets and appenders
NLog.CommandLineTool | Receive log messages via TCP in your terminal
NLog.Unity | Integrates NLog into Unity for code free setup

## Getting started

### LogLevel
NLog is a very light and flexible logging library. You can log messages based on their importance, e.g. you might want to log general messages with a debug log level, but unexpected messages with a warning log level. NLog provides the following log levels
- Trace
- Debug
- Info
- Warn
- Error
- Fatal

### Appender
Its plugin architecture lets you add multiple different appenders to handle log messages. An appender is a delegate method which contains the logic for processing log messages. It might write a message to a file, print it with Console.WriteLine, send it over the network via TCP, etc. You can easily write your own appenders. There are no limits!

NLog ships with a handful pre-made appenders and helper classes
- SocketAppender, either as TcpClientSocket or as TcpServerSocket
- SOSMaxAppender, which sends messages over the network to [SOSMax](http://www.sos.powerflasher.com)
- FileWriter

### Commandline Tool
To receive messages in your terminal, you can use the bundled commandline tool nlog.exe, which you can either setup as a TcpClientSocket or a TcpServerSocket.

```
$ nlog.exe
nlog [-l port]    - listen on port
nlog [-c ip port] - connect to ip on port
[-v]              - verbose output
[-vv]             - even more verbose output

# This will listen on port 1234
$ nlog.exe -l 1234

# This will connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 1234
$ nlog.exe -c 127.0.0.1 1234
```

### NLog.Unity
NLog.Unity adds even more appender. No code needed for setup!
- ClientSocketAppender
- ServerSocketAppender
- SOSMaxSocketAppender
- FileAppender
- DebugLogAppender

Implementing your appender is as easy as writing a single delegate method.

## Setup NLog

If you're using NLog with Unity, you can skip this section and [jump to 'Setup NLog in Unity'.](#setup-nlog-in-unity)

```cs
LoggerFactory.globalLogLevel = LogLevel.On;

// Add appender to print messages with Console.WriteLine
LoggerFactory.AddAppender((logger, logLevel, message) => Console.WriteLine(message));

// Add another appender to write messages to a file
var fileWriter = new FileWriter("Log.txt");
LoggerFactory.AddAppender((logger, logLevel, message) => fileWriter.WriteLine(message));

// Or simply create your own custom appender, e.g.
// a custom error reporter, which only sends messages
// if the log level is at least 'error'
LoggerFactory.AddAppender((logger, logLevel, message) => {
    if (logLevel >= LogLevel.Error) {
        myErrorReporter.Send(logLevel + " " + message);
    }
});
```

## Example
Send log messages over the network via TCP
```cs
// Setup appender
var defaultFormatter = new DefaultLogMessageFormatter();
var colorFormatter = new ColorCodeFormatter();
var socket = new SocketAppender();
LoggerFactory.AddAppender(((logger, logLevel, message) => {
    message = defaultFormatter.FormatMessage(logger, logLevel, message);
    message = colorFormatter.FormatMessage(logLevel, message);
    socket.Send(logLevel, message);
}));

// Setup as client
socket.Connect(IPAddress.Loopback, 1234);

// Or setup as server
// socket.Listen(1234);
```

```cs
public class MyClass {
    static readonly Logger _log = LoggerFactory.GetLogger(typeof(MyClass).Name);

    public MyClass() {
        _log.Trace("trace");
        _log.Debug("debug");
        _log.Info("info");
        _log.Warn("warning");
        _log.Error("error");
        _log.Fatal("fatal");
    }
}
```

Send log messages to SOSMax
```cs
var defaultFormatter = new DefaultLogMessageFormatter();
var socket = new SOSMaxAppender();
LoggerFactory.AddAppender(((logger, logLevel, message) => {
    message = defaultFormatter.FormatMessage(logger, logLevel, message);
    socket.Send(logLevel, message);
}));

socket.Connect(IPAddress.Loopback, 4444);
```

# Setup NLog in Unity
You don't have to write any code to setup NLog in Unity. Just drag the NLog prefab into your scene and you're ready to go.

![NLog Unity](Readme/NLog-Unity.png)

By default, the NLog prefab has already a ClientSocketAppender attached but you can add or remove appenders to fit your requirements. In the image above I also added a FileAppender. The log level set in NLogConfig is applied to all loggers, which makes filtering messages very easy. You can also turn off completely.

![NLog Unity](Readme/NLog-Unity-LogLevel.png)

When checking 'Catch Unity Logs' you can also handle all existing Debug.Log calls and send them via NLog.
